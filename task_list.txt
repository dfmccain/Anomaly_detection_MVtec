Task List

X   Modularize the Code:
        Convert the notebook into a modular Python project with separate files for data handling,
        model definition, training, and evaluation. This will help you better manage and extend the codebase.
    Explore Different Optimizers:
        Experiment with different optimizers like Adam, SGD.
        Document the differences in training performance and final accuracy.
    Try Various Learning Rate Schedulers:
        Implement learning rate schedulers (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau, StepLR).
        Observe how each impacts the model's training speed and convergence.
    Modify the Autoencoder Architecture:
        Experiment with changing the number of layers and channels in the encoder and decoder.
        Try a deeper or shallower architecture, and analyze how these changes affect the modelâ€™s ability to detect anomalies.
    Experiment with Image Size:
        Test different input image sizes (e.g., 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512).
        Observe the impact on model performance and training time.
        Note any trade-offs between image resolution and accuracy.
    Hyperparameter Tuning and Ablation Study:
        Perform ablation studies by adjusting learning rate, batch size, and training epochs.
        Use TensorBoard to log and compare different runs.
    Data Augmentation:
        Experiment with data augmentation techniques in the data_transform function (e.g., rotations, flips).
        Analyze how these augmentations impact model performance.
    TensorBoard Integration:
        Log training/validation losses, SSIM metrics, and example reconstructions in TensorBoard to visually monitor your progress.
    Summarize Your Findings:
        For experiments, send me the tensorboard visualizations, such as which settings performed best and why certain configurations worked better than others.
